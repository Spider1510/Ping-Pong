# Ping Pong
This is a beginner attempt to write a java code using concepts like Multi-threading, AWT, ActionListener, KeyListener, etc
The basic work of frame is already done.
Basic things like moving the pad with arrow keys and bouncing the ball from walls are working

What's not working -
1) The ball should bounce only when it hits the pad. But the ball is bouncing every time even though it doesn't hit the pad.
2) The code for the scoring system is not yet added.
3) There is no opponent..!! Right now I am thinking we should focus on the 1st problem. This can be addressed later.

feel free to edit this list if you find any other problems
